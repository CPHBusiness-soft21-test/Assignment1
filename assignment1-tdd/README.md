## Reflections 

### 1.1	SHOOTING 
A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible reasons for the man not dying.

-	It was a prop gun
-	No bullets 
-	It was a non-fatal shot
-	It was at the hospital, and was a non-fatal shot
-	The ambulance was there, and it was a non-fatal shot.
-	He was bullet proof
-	Horrendous and inaccurate shooting. 
-	The gun blew up. 
-	His bodyguard took the bullet for him.
-	Thunder struck the bullet. 
-	She couldn’t do it. 

### 1.2	ALIEN 
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-bystep instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can.

1.	Go to bathroom.
2.	Stand front facing the sink. 
3.	Optional, but preferred, use sink with mirror attached above sink so you’re able to look at yourself. 
4.	Grab the bottom of toothbrush with left hand. Bottom does not have any toothbrush hairs on it. 
5.	Turn on cold water with right hand. ~~<span style="color:red">Look at sink handle, there’s usually a blue and a red color indicator for cold and warm water. Turn handle towards the blue color as far as it goes, and turn on, usually by lifting the handle, but some handles turn on by pulling to the side, and some activate by hand movement, there’s a lot of different types of sinks what the.</span>~~ Look at your sink manual on how to do this.
6.	Take toothbrush and wet the hairs of it from the water running of the sink.
7.	Take toothpaste with your right hand and unscrew the cap by turning clockwise. If it doesn’t turn then turn anti-clockwise. 
8.	Hold the toothpaste over the toothbrush hairs and cover the top part of the hairs with toothpaste. This is usually done by starting at one end of the hairs, squeezing the tube so that toothpaste comes out, and then moving the tube along the hairs to the other end. Humans argue about how much toothpaste should be used, just follow your heart(s). 
9.	You now have a toothbrush with wet hairs and toothpaste upon the hairs. 
10.	Grab bottom of toothbrush with right hand. 
11.	Start by placing toothbrush hairs on your teeth furthest back in your mouth on the top row on the left side, on the surface facing outwards. Surface also known as front of the tooth. 
a.	You can choose top or bottom row of teeth to start at, and even right or left side, we will be covering both rows and sides.
12.	 Now to start brushing, move the toothbrush in a horizontal motion, make sure to cover the entire tooth that you’ve started at. When one tooth feels covered, move on to the tooth next to it, until you’ve brushed every single tooth on that surface. 
13.	Now do the same on the second row, which should be the bottom if you followed step 11. 
14.	Now it’s time for the bottom of the teeth, again place the toothbrush hairs on the furthest back tooth on the top row left side, bottom surface. 
15.	Follow step 12.
16.	Now for the back side of the tooth, again place the toothbrush hairs on the furthest back tooth on the top row left side, back surface.
17.	Follow step 12. 
18.	To ensure good dental health make sure to also brush your gums. Again, place the toothbrush hairs on the furthest back tooth on the top row left side, on the gums.
19.	Sort of like step 12, brush in a horizontal motion, but this time there’s not an exposed tooth! Make sure to cover every single area of your gums with the toothbrush hairs. 
20.	Do same for bottom gums. 	


## My thoughts on TDD

Forcing yourself to use TDD is a bit more tedious than just doing the implementation. But this was also a pretty easy calculator to code. I do see the benefits of programming this way, and do appreciate it. I don't know if it's just this example, but i did find it hard to figure out what the smallest implementation would be, but i just took a decision. Think it would be interesting working with TDD on an assignment that's a bit larger scale. 

In the methods of assignment1, I've commented the code out that was the smallest implementation. 

## My thoughts on BDD

This wasn't a part of the assignment, but we had an in class exercise with BDD and decided to implement it to the assignment. BDD was also fun to work with, until i started working on the second test, this caused a lot of problems which i spent way too long on, and ended up abandoning it. I've kept the code in but just commented it out, so that the project can run.
